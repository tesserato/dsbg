In addition to minor improvements, particularly to the default themes, version 0.0.5 of DSBG introduces support for share buttons. These buttons utilize native intent APIs to facilitate sharing on Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, and X. We opted to implement this feature from scratch, rather than relying on a third-party library, to ensure the generated pages remain as fast and tracking-free as possible. At their core, these share buttons are simply static links generated during compilation. Each SVG icon is approximately 1 KB, ensuring a negligible impact on performance.
