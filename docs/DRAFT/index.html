        <p>In the current day and era I guess most of us have a ton of bookmarked content, and considerable amount of internal notes and documents and whatnot that we keep in services like Google Keep and Obsidian.</p>
<p>For a couple of years now I have been searching for a frictionless way to publish this content. Social networks come and go, so the most future proof medium always struck me as the good old blog.</p>
<p>My ideal workflow would be to write or edit the content the way I already do for my personal wiki, that current consists of markdown files in an obsidian vault, and issue a command to have everything transformed into a static website, with a RSS feed updated accordingly, that I could host is services like GitHub Pages, Netlify or Firebase.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I set out to investigate what was available. Behemoths like Wordpress and self hosted Ghost were out of the picture from the get go, as I wanted something lightweight and simple.</p>
<p>Hugo claims of speed were alluring, but I ended up finding it too complex.  In Jekyll's case, I believe the problem was with liquid, their own templating engine, and the Ruby dependencies. I also looked into Grav, Eleventy, Pelican and Nikola, but was ultimately unsatisfied, for a reason or another. So I set out to build my own static site generator. My <a href="https://github.com/tesserato/ContentManager">first attempt</a> was in Rust, and I was actually making slow but steady progress with it in my free time.</p>
<p>Fast forward to around September 2024, when I go fed up with how much Python sucks for large codebases, and started to look for a static typed and ideally compiled language with whom I could be as productive as I am in Python. I decided to give Go a try and, after reading a few books and trying my hand in a minor project, I decided to port what I already had in Rust to Go. In a couple of days the Go version already had feature parity with the barebones Rust implementation. A short 3 months later, I am proud to present the Dead Simple Blog Generator (DSBG), a static site generator written in Go.</p>
