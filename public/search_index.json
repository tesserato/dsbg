Assembly? a bit too much, if you ask me. What, then? Come along and find out.\r\n\r\n I guess it makes sense that my first blog post would be about how to set up a blog. But first, let's take a look at my background and motivation to know why I decided to start a blog, and what would be the best approach to do so, considering technologies I'm already familiar with.\r\n\r\n You see, recently I started to use Obsidian to store thoughts and incomplete ideas, and to record pieces of information that might be useful in the future. The problem is that, as it is meant to be consumed by myself only, it is hard to find the motivation to really polish those notes. I see no point in dating them, too, so, you eventually are in a situation when you don't know if that preliminary research in how to embed 3D animations in HTML is reasonably up to date, or if it is worth redoing it in face of new tech that might have emerged.\r\n\r\n The motivation to set up a blog is twofold, then: maybe gather a small community about general nerdy topics and put in place a live knowledge system, that can be referred back by me and this community, with opinions about relevant technologies.\r\n\r\n To sum it up:\r\n\r\n \r\nGit, git everywhere! \r\nMarkdown too, please, but that is kind of standard nowadays I remember when I started to dabble with HTML, back in the day, and my first thought was \"who the hell came up with this bloated syntax?\" \r\nFree, and preferably open-source \r\nclosest to a static website as possible \r\nA comment system, to get some insight and feedback \r\nintegrations with LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and possible others, like medium \r\nSet and forget - given my tendency to tinkering, the more separation of concerns, the better \r\nMailing list \r\nRSS I almost forgot about this one \r\n \r\n\r\nPossible setups\r\n\r\n Reading about content management systems (CMS) on the internet, some alternatives catched my eye:\r\n\r\n \r\nGhost \r\nGrav \r\nJekyll \r\nhttps://www.11ty.dev/ \r\nhttps://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html# \r\nhttps://gohugo.io/ \r\nhttps://getnikola.com/ \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nComment systems\r\n\r\n \r\ndisqus \r\nhttps://staticman.net/ \r\nhttps://www.talkyard.io/ \r\nhttps://flarum.org/ \r\nhttps://utteranc.es/ \r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n Pandoc + Python's beautiful soup\r\n\r\n Useful links\r\n\r\n \r\nhttps://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/eleventy-static-site-generator/ \r\nhttp://www.theappliedarchitect.com/setup-a-free-self-hosted-blog-in-under-15-minutes/ \r\nhttps://kabardinovd.com/posts/eleventy-staticman/ \r\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/-how-to-create-and-deploy-your-first-eleventy-website \r\nhttps://benmyers.dev/blog/eleventy-data-cascade/ \r\nhttps://blog.bartekr.net/2021/01/17/testing-utterances-comments/ \r\nhttps://donw.io/post/github-comments/ \r\nhttps://jamstack.org/generators/ \r\nhttps://www.arthurkoziel.com/convert-md-to-html-pandoc/ \r\n It's 2024 now and much has changed: I changed countries, sold my house, worked like there is no tomorrow to develop a NLP agent in a startup, and here I am, retaking this project. I ended up developing a static site generator in Rust, that I intend to publish when it gets a little bit more polished.\r\n\r\n ","description":"In this post I explore how a veritable nerd goes about setting a blog.

Then, around 500,000 years ago, a spark ignited a revolution. This article explores the surprising origins of groundbreaking inventions like spearpoints, fire, and the bow and arrow, revealing how these innovations spread not through independent discovery, but through a network of sharing across early human populations.\r\n\r\n This post was generated from the article https://theconversation.com/how-a-handful-of-prehistoric-geniuses-launched-humanitys-technological-revolution-171511 using Gemini.\r\n\r\n Ancient Innovation: Sharing Secrets that Sparked a Technological Revolution\r\n\r\n For millions of years, our ancestors chipped away at progress, slowly developing tools like hand-axes and crude choppers. Then, around 500,000 years ago, things took a dramatic turn. Spearpoints, fire-making, axes, beads, and bows all burst onto the scene, marking a period of rapid technological advancement.\r\n\r\n This wasn't the work of a single group. Clever minds across different populations – modern Homo sapiens, early humans, and possibly even Neanderthals – came up with these inventions, and then the knowledge spread. It seems these innovations weren't independently discovered, but rather shared like secrets passed from one tribe to the next.\r\n\r\n Highlights from the Early Innovators' Toolkit:\r\n\r\n \r\nThe Spearpoint: This revolutionary weapon, combining a stone blade with a wooden shaft, first appeared in southern Africa 500,000 years ago. Evidence suggests it spread gradually, reaching Europe by 250,000 years ago, likely carried by Neanderthals. \r\nFire Mastery: Around 400,000 years ago, widespread use of fire became common across continents. This likely coincided with the invention of the fire drill, a tool still used today. Interestingly, the oldest evidence for regular fire use comes from Europe, suggesting Neanderthals might have been the first fire masters (https://forums.arrowheads.com/media/kunena/attachments/1841/BowDrillInNorthAmerica.pdf). \r\nThe Hafting Revolution: Hand-axes were replaced by core-axes around 270,000 years ago. These new tools were designed to be attached to handles, creating a much more efficient axe. This innovation spread quickly through Africa and then accompanied modern humans on their migrations. \r\nEarly Adornment: The oldest known beads are 140,000 years old and were made by archaic Homo sapiens in North Africa. Beads later appeared in Europe worn by Neanderthals and eventually reached modern humans in southern Africa. (https://www.thebeadchest.com/pages/oldest-beads-world) \r\nThe Bow and Arrow: This silent but deadly weapon emerged in southern Africa over 70,000 years ago. Bows spread throughout the world, reaching the Americas a mere 12,000 years ago. Notably, Neanderthals never adopted this technology. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow) \r\n \r\n\r\nHow Did Ideas Spread?\r\n\r\n Long-distance travel for early humans was likely uncommon. So, how did these innovations travel vast distances? The answer seems to be a network of knowledge exchange. Ideas and tools were passed from one tribe to the next, creating a chain that connected people across continents.\r\n\r\n Conflict might have played a role, with tools captured or stolen during skirmishes. However, trade was probably a more common method. Even today, hunter-gatherer societies exchange goods, and this behavior likely dates back much further.\r\n\r\n Generosity also shouldn't be discounted. Perhaps some technological advancements were simply gifts exchanged during peaceful interactions between groups.\r\n\r\n The Power of a Single Mind\r\n\r\n The pattern of single-source innovation followed by widespread diffusion suggests that progress might have been more dependent on individual genius than previously thought. Consider the bow. Its effectiveness seems almost inevitable, yet it wasn't invented independently across the globe. Instead, one person's ingenuity changed the course of history for millennia.\r\n\r\n This echoes what we see in historical times. While some inventions arose multiple times (farming, writing), others, like the printing press or the compass, seem to have a single origin story. This highlights the impact that a single creative mind can have on the trajectory of human progress.\r\n\r\n The takeaway? Technological advancements may not be inevitable, but rather the result of bursts of brilliance shared and spread across our species. These early innovators, with their ingenious solutions, laid the foundation for the technological marvels we enjoy today.\r\n\r\n ","description":"For millions of years, progress was slow.

This post explores the hidden challenges of software development, from maintaining mental models of large codebases to navigating the complexities of long-term projects. While rapid prototyping has its place, building lasting software requires a different approach.\r\n\r\n I'm toying with the program that I made to generate this blog for less than an hour, and found a bug already - tags must always be passed as a list. Also, besides other polishing needed, long tags are being formatted strangely. That reminded me of one thing that became abundantly clear for me in the last year or so: building software is hard. It is hard even when you are doing it as a side project, without time constraints. Building something relatively foolproof, to be used in real life. You know what I mean, right? Not a script, real software, reasonably reliable, that can be used, even if for a simple case, but usable in real life.\r\n\r\n Sure, hacking something together that just works, in a few sittings, is a lot easier. While it is possible, be it because you are regularly working on the codebase, or because the codebase is not very large, to maintain a model of what you are doing in your mind, almost everything goes.\r\n\r\n I'm no purist, mind you. It is awesome to do that. You can think in code, develop an idea almost at the same time as you reap its results. But when that is not the case, everything changes. About 4 years ago I was just arguing with a friend about the freedom that dynamic languages provide.\r\n\r\n Beyond the Weekend Hack: The Hidden Challenges of Building Software\r\n\r\n The exhilaration of a quick coding win can be intoxicating. You bang out a program in a few sessions, and it works exactly as planned. Pure magic, right? But for those who've ventured beyond the weekend hack, a different reality sets in. Building software, especially complex or long-term projects, presents a unique set of challenges that rapid prototyping simply can't prepare you for.\r\n\r\n In the initial stages of a project, when the codebase is small and fresh in your mind, it's easy to operate on a mental model you've built within your head. You can think in code, seamlessly translating ideas into functionality and reaping the rewards of your ingenuity almost instantaneously. This \"hacking something together\" approach has its undeniable appeal, fostering a rapid iteration cycle and allowing you to experiment freely.\r\n\r\n However, as projects mature and the codebase expands, that initial mental model starts to fray. Keeping track of complex interactions, dependencies, and edge cases becomes a mental juggling act. The thrill of rapid creation gives way to the slow, meticulous work of software maintenance. Debugging becomes a detective game, tracing cryptic error messages back to their source within a labyrinth of interconnected code.\r\n\r\n The hidden challenge of software development lies in this transition. It's the shift from the playground of rapid prototyping to the structured world of long-term development. It requires a change in mindset, a move towards planning, documentation, and a more rigorous approach to code organization.\r\n\r\n Don't get me wrong, there's still room for creativity and experimentation in the world of complex software. But it's a different kind of creativity, one that thrives within constraints and thrives on a deep understanding of the system as a whole. Mastering this long-term approach is what separates the weekend hackers from the true software engineers. It's the ability to see beyond the initial spark of inspiration and build software that not only works but endures.\r\n\r\n ","description":"Ever breeze through a quick coding project, only to hit a wall when tackling something more complex?
