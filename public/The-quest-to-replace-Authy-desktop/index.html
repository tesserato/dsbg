Recently, or not that much, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1aphpcq/comment/kqabx9u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" rel="nofollow">Authy decided to discontinue its desktop auth</a>. I’ve been using it for quite a long time, and was actually quite happy with it.
Nevertheless, had to start searching for a new app. Long story short, I think I’ll be settling for the <a href="https://pass.proton.me/" rel="nofollow">Proton Pass</a> app for now. The real contenders apparently boil down to three:

- <a href="https://pass.proton.me/" rel="nofollow">Proton Pass</a>
- <a href="https://www.zoho.com/accounts/oneauth/authenticator-app.html" rel="nofollow">Zoho</a>
- <a href="https://auth.ente.io/login" rel="nofollow">Ente Auth</a>
