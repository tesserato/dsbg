I&#39;ve been using it for quite a long time, and was actually quite happy with it.
Nevertheless, had to start searching for a new app. Long story short, I think I&#39;ll be settling for the <a href="https://pass.proton.me/" rel="nofollow">Proton Pass</a> app for now. The real contenders apparently boil down to three:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pass.proton.me/" rel="nofollow">Proton Pass</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.zoho.com/accounts/oneauth/authenticator-app.html" rel="nofollow">Zoho</a></li>
<li><a href="https://auth.ente.io/login" rel="nofollow">Ente Auth</a></li>
</ul>
