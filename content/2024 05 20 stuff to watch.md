- [ ] [Big Bug](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11541872/) I think I started watching this at some point...
- [ ] [The Legend of Vox Machina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11247158/) Same here: started, didn't think too much of it, but perhaps should give it another go.
- [ ] [The Oblongs](https://boingboing.net/2022/01/28/the-oblongs-a-hidden-gem-in-adult-animation.html) Never watched back in the day. This post kindled my interest tough.
- [ ] [The Spine of Night](https://gizmodo.com/the-spine-of-night-is-the-gory-animated-fantasy-epic-of-1846514874) [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3885422/)
- [ ] [Undone](https://gizmodo.com/amazons-undone-is-a-surreal-and-visually-stunning-serie-1837853277) [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8101850/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
- [ ] [Upload](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7826376/) Watching this one. Nice little show. I think I stopped at season 2.
- [ ] [Bravest Warriors](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2474952/?ref_=tt_mv_close)
- [ ] [Severance](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/severance-is-sci-fi-for-the-soul) [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/)
