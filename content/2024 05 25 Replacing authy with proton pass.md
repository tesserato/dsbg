Recently, or not that much, [Authy decided to discontinue its desktop auth](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1aphpcq/comment/kqabx9u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I've been using it for quite a long time, and was actually quite happy with it.
Nevertheless, had to start searching for a new app. Long story short, I think I'll be settling for the [Proton Pass](https://pass.proton.me/) app for now. The real contenders apparently boil down to three:

- [Proton Pass](https://pass.proton.me/)
- [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/oneauth/authenticator-app.html)
- [Ente Auth](https://auth.ente.io/login)
