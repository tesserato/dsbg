LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively - Larry McEnerney

think about your readers
change the way the readers see the world

Writing - Valuable > persuasive > organized > clear
	valuable to readers - keep journal in mind
	explain only after the values above are attained

Writing is not communicating your ideas to the reader -> It is changin their ideas

our readers have the professional function of challenging what we present

DON'T USE: new, original, novel, etc...

reknowed specialists in the field get to say what knowledge is

know your readers -> tell them they're wrong inside the code
value words - indicate community
flow words
problem catering to the readers -> solution
