description: Ever breeze through a quick coding project, only to hit a wall when tackling something more complex? This post explores the hidden challenges of software development, from maintaining mental models of large codebases to navigating the complexities of long-term projects. While rapid prototyping has its place, building lasting software requires a different approach.

I'm toying with the program that I made to generate this blog for less than an hour, and found a bug already - tags must always be passed as a list. Also, besides other polishing needed, long tags are being formatted strangely. That reminded me of one thing that became abundantly clear for me in the last year or so: building software is hard. It is hard even when you are doing it as a side project, without time constraints. Building something relatively foolproof, to be used in real life. You know what I mean, right? Not a script, real software, reasonably reliable, that can be used, even if for a simple case, but usable in real life.

Sure, hacking something together that just works, in a few sittings,  is a lot easier. While it is possible, be it because you are regularly working on the codebase, or because the codebase is not very large, to maintain a model of what you are doing in your mind, almost everything goes.

I'm no purist, mind you. It is awesome to do that. You can think in code, develop an idea almost at the same time as you reap its results. But when that is not the case, everything changes. About 4 years ago I was just arguing with a friend about the freedom that dynamic languages provide.

## Beyond the Weekend Hack: The Hidden Challenges of Building Software

The exhilaration of a quick coding win can be intoxicating. You bang out a program in a few sessions, and it works exactly as planned. Pure magic, right? But for those who've ventured beyond the weekend hack, a different reality sets in. Building software, especially complex or long-term projects, presents a unique set of challenges that rapid prototyping simply can't prepare you for.

In the initial stages of a project, when the codebase is small and fresh in your mind, it's easy to operate on a mental model you've built within your head. You can think in code, seamlessly translating ideas into functionality and reaping the rewards of your ingenuity almost instantaneously. This "hacking something together" approach has its undeniable appeal, fostering a rapid iteration cycle and allowing you to experiment freely.

However, as projects mature and the codebase expands, that initial mental model starts to fray. Keeping track of complex interactions, dependencies, and edge cases becomes a mental juggling act. The thrill of rapid creation gives way to the slow, meticulous work of software maintenance. Debugging becomes a detective game, tracing cryptic error messages back to their source within a labyrinth of interconnected code. 

The hidden challenge of software development lies in this transition. It's the shift from the playground of rapid prototyping to the structured world of long-term development. It requires a change in mindset, a move towards planning, documentation, and a more rigorous approach to code organization. 

Don't get me wrong, there's still room for creativity and experimentation in the world of complex software. But it's a different kind of creativity, one that thrives within constraints and thrives on a deep understanding of the system as a whole. Mastering this long-term approach is what separates the weekend hackers from the true software engineers. It's the ability to see beyond the initial spark of inspiration and build software that not only works but endures.
