title: Reading list
description: I'll keep my reading list here, for quick access.

I was keeping my reading list in a folder of markdown files that I manage with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app. It makes more sense to manage it here, however, so I can reach it wherever and whenever needed. I also intend to update it regularly changing and reposting this post, to not only track what I have already read (that can be seen in my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6395084-tesserato?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read) account), but also what I was intending to read at any given point.
